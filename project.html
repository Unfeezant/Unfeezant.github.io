            <h1>Python Ludo</h1>
            <p>This project is a 2-player Ludo game implemented entirely in Python without using any external libraries. It features custom logic for dice generation, token movement rules, safe spots, turn management, and victory conditions, all written with fundamental Python constructs.</p>
            <h2>CODE (with explaination)</h2>

                <figcaption>This is the design of the classical Ludo board, which has been made with the help of a 2-D list.<br>Each box in the board is an element in the list.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>These are the designs of the tokens which will be moving over the board, also made with a  2-D list</figcaption>

                <figcaption>The whole path of each token has been numbered to keep track of the tokens.<br>All the safe spots are corresponded to particular numbers.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>By satisfying these conditions, each token will be able to cut the other token.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>Once the token has been cut or moved forward, the board needs to reset and just remember the position of the token moved.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>After rolling the dice, this is how the pieces move.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>The dice is rolled using the random library and checks if the token user selects is movable or not.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>Once all the tokens are at "HOME" the colour wins.</figcaption>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to create a functional and enjoyable Ludo game that can be played by two players using only Python's built-in capabilities. It aims to demonstrate how complex game mechanics can be implemented without relying on external libraries, showcasing the versatility and power of core Python programming.</p>
            <p>Made it 2-player because adding more players is just a matter of copying and pasting this code.<br>But the main task was to make it playable with all the rules.</p>
