                <h3>Schooling</h3>
                <p>I completed my schooling from St. Thomas School, Dwarka, New Delhi. I was a bright and active student throughout my school years. However, during the lockdown, like many other students,<br>I faced challenges in adapting to online learning, which affected my academic performance in Class 9 and led to lower grades. Despite that setback, I made a strong comeback in Class 10 by scoring 95% overall.<br> My performance continued to improve in the following years, and in Class 12, I secured 94.5% while simultaneously preparing for my competitive exam (JEE) alongside my studies in Classes 11 and 12.</p>
